            <p class="content">Stock markets worldwide surge on positive economic indicators. The S&P 500 Index continued to climb to record highs, although the market’s gains remained notably narrow. As measured by Russell 1000 indexes, growth shares outperformed value stocks by 415 basis points (4.15 percentage points), while the small- and mid-cap benchmarks recorded losses. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite ended the week 73.71% off its lows since the market began its rebound in mid- to late-2022, while the more value-oriented and narrowly focused Dow Jones Industrial Average had gained less than half of that amount, 32.79%. Markets were closed Thursday in observance of the Independence Day holiday, and T. Rowe Price traders noted lighter trading volumes as the week progressed.</p>

            <img src="5.webp" alt="Record High Temperatures in Arctic">
            <p class="content">Arctic region experiences unprecedented heatwaves, impacting wildlife and ecosystems. The highest temperature ever recorded on the most northern side of the planet has been officially confirmed by the WMO on 20 June 2020 in the Siberian town of Verkhoyansk: 38°C. Temperatures in the Arctic are raising at a rate more than twice the global average. This is causing record numbers of "zombie fires" because of the burning of carbon-rich peat, the thawing of permafrost and the breaking up of Arctic's thickest ice. The highest temperature ever recorded in the Arctic was 38°C (100.4°F) in the Russian town of Verkhoyansk on June 20, 2020. The temperature was recorded during a prolonged Siberian heatwave, and the town is located about 115 kilometers north of the Arctic Circle. The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) added a new climate category to its international archive to recognize the record.</p>

            <img src="6.0.jpg" alt="Tourism">
            <p class="content">Tourist arrivals surge as travel restrictions ease globally. If you were desperate to get away after the restrictions and enforced staying at home of the pandemic years, you were far from alone. Global international tourist arrivals are expected to meet pre-pandemic levels in 2024 driven by this pent-up demand. But, the recovery of the travel and tourism sector since the pandemic has not been without challenges. Add to that macroeconomic, geopolitical and environmental factors, which have added pressures on the industry. These pressures will amplify and evolve over the coming years and, along with the growth of digital technologies and AI, may well force the travel industry to adapt. Some economies are better placed than others to make these changes, respond to future risks and ensure that travel and tourism is a driver of economic growth and prosperity.</p>

            <p class="content">The festival has begun across the nation for the fans and the audiences, as Hombale Films' Salaar Part 1: CeaseFire has finally been released in cinemas across the nation on Friday (December 22).

The fans and the audiences were waiting to experience the film on the big screens right from the announcement, and with the action entertainer now released in cinemas, the biggest action entertainer has brought a mass carnival for the fans and also at the box office.</p>

            <img src="9.webp">
            <p class="content">Director John Krasinski‘s “IF,” a fantasy-comedy that promises your imaginary friends from
                childhood are real, fell slightly short of box office expectations with $33.7 million — below Sunday’s estimates of $35 million.

                Heading into the weekend, “IF” was expected to bring in at least $40 million in its first weekend of release. Based on Friday’s turnout, it looked like “IF” would open to $30 million but projections were revised up after Saturday’s strong showing. Ticket sales were enough for first place — and decent for an original PG family film — but it’s a wobbly start for a movie that cost $110 million to make and many millions more to market. It collected an additional $20 million overseas for a global total of $55 million.</p>

Yusuf pathan hugs him. He is still crying. Last tIme Sri Lanka won the tournament, and beat India, one Indian cricketer left the arena in tears of sorrow. Now it's the opposite. Crazy scenes out there. Camera pans to Dhoni who has his cap pulled down, his right arm wipes off some sweat. slowly he looks up and high-fives with a team-mate. Gary Kirsten is out there.
